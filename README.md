# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.
Markdown isn’t like Microsoft Word or Libre Office. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications

# Why Use Markdown?

- Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.

- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely

- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and **GitHub** support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.


# How Does it Work?

Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.

To summarize, this is a four-part process:
- Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
- Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
- Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
- View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.


# Documents

Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.

Here are some Markdown document authoring applications I recommend:

- Mac : [MacDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/macdown/), [iA Writer](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ia-writer/), [Marked 2](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/marked-2/)

- ios/Android : [iA Writer](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ia-writer/)

- Windows : [ghostwriter](https://kde.github.io/ghostwriter/), [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/)

- Linux : [ghostwriter](https://kde.github.io/ghostwriter/)

- Web : [Dillinger](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/dillinger/),[StackEdit](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/stackedit/) 


# Websites
Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.

If you’re looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files, check out [blot.im](https://blot.im/). After you sign up for Blot, it creates a Dropbox folder on your computer. Just drag and drop your Markdown files into the folder and — poof! — they’re on your website. It couldn’t be easier.

If you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/), a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website. One advantage to this approach is that [GitHub Pages](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/) provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites. If Jekyll isn’t your cup of tea, just pick one of the many others[tatic site generators available](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

If you’d like to use a content management system (CMS) to power your website, take a look at [Ghost](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ghost/). It’s a free and open-source blogging platform with a nice Markdown editor. If you’re a WordPress user, you’ll be happy to know there’s [Markdown support](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/) for websites hosted on WordPress.com. Self-hosted WordPress sites can use the [Jetpack plugin](https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-blocks/markdown-block/).

# Presentations
Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a lot faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or Keynote. Remark [GitHub project](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is a popular browser-based Markdown slideshow tool, as are Cleaver [GitHub project](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver) and Marp [GitHub project](https://github.com/marp-team/marp). If you use a Mac and would prefer to use an application, check out [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/) or [Hyperdeck](https://hyperdeck.io/).

# Email
If you send a lot of email and you’re tired of the formatting controls available on most email provider websites, you’ll be happy to learn there’s an easy way to write email messages using Markdown. [Markdown Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/markdown-here/) is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that’s ready to send.

# Collaboration
Collaboration and team messaging applications are a popular way of communicating with coworkers and friends at work and home. These applications don’t utilize all of Markdown’s features, but the features they do provide are fairly useful. For example, the ability to bold and italicize text without using the WYSIWYG interface is pretty handy. [Slack](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/slack/), [Discord](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/discord/), [Wiki.js](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/wiki-js/), and [Mattermost](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mattermost/) are all good collaboration applications.

# Books
Looking to self-publish a novel? Try [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/), a service that takes your Markdown-formatted files and turns them into an electronic book. Leanpub outputs your book in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI file format. If you’d like to create paperback copies of your book, you can upload the PDF file to another service such as [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/). To learn more about writing and self-publishing a book using Markdown, [read this blog post](https://medium.com/techspiration-ideas-making-it-happen/how-i-wrote-and-published-my-novel-using-only-open-source-tools-5cdfbd7c00ca).


# Documentation
Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation
If you write documentation for a product or service, take a look at these handy tools:
- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) can generate a documentation website from your open source Markdown files. Just connect your GitHub repository to their service and push — Read the Docs does the rest. They also have a service for [commercial entities](https://readthedocs.com/). 

- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) is a static site generator powered by Vue and optimized for writing technical documentation.

- [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/) was mentioned earlier in the section on websites, but it’s also a good option for generating a documentation website from Markdown files. If you go this route, be sure to check out the [Jekyll documentation theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).

- [Docusaurus](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/docusaurus/) is a static site generator designed exclusively for creating documentation websites. It supports translations, search, and versioning.

- [MkDocs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/) is a fast and simple static site generator that’s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single YAML configuration file. MkDocs has several built in [themes](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/choosing-your-theme/), including a port of the Read the Docs documentation theme for use with MkDocs. One of the newest themes is [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
